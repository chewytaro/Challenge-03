# Password Generator

## Description 
This is a password generator that allows users to generate a password that fits their needs as they are able to choose the length of desired password and whether or not the password contains the following: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters. This website was built upon a partially written code, allowing me to focus on mainly coding in JavaScript to finish the website and ensuring that the prompts that allow users to curate their passwords actually work. 

This is the link to the website: https://chewytaro.github.io/Password-Generator/
This is what the site should look like:

## Usage 
When users want to generate a password, they will be prompted to answer the length of the password that they want and also whether they want to include: lowercase, uppercase, numbers and/or special characters. After answering these prompts, a newly generated password will appear and fits all of the users' needs.
