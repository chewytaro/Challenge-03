# Password Generator

## Description 
This is a password generator that allows users to generate a password that fits their needs as they are able to choose the length of desired password and whether or not the password contains the following: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters. This website was built upon a partially written code, allowing me to focus on mainly coding in JavaScript to finish the website and ensuring that the prompts that allow users to curate their passwords actually work. 

## Installation
N/A

## Usage 
When users want to generate a password, they will be prompted to answer the length of the password that they want and also whether they want to include: lowercase, uppercase, numbers and/or special characters. After answering these prompts, a newly generated password will appear and fits all of the users' needs. 

## Credits
Starter code was provided by UW Full Stack Bootcamp, JavaScript was added in after by Wendy Vu.
